Fullsize Photosets
------------------
Simply drop this script into your blog and photosets will automatically grow to fit the full width of their container object. Degrades gracefully in browsers that don't have JavaScript enabled. Where available, high res images will be used.

Include the script and add the following theme code to the immediate parent container that holds the photoset:
`rel='{JSPhotosetLayout}'`
